Duplex, Transform and Passthrough Streams


**Duplex Streams**
- What: Can both read AND write data independently
- Use: Network connections, WebSockets, TCP sockets


**Transform Streams**
- What: Modifies data as it passes through (input → transform → output)
- Use: Data processing, compression, encryption

**Passthrough Streams**
- What: Passes data through without modification
- Use: Monitoring, logging, testing streams

-> Key Difference: Transform modifies data, PassThrough just observes, Duplex handles bidirectional communication.
