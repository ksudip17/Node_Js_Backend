Writable Streams in Node.js
A Writable Stream is a stream where you can write data to. Think of it like a pipe where you can pour water in - the stream accepts data and processes it (could be saving to file, sending over network, etc.).
Core Concept

Purpose: Accept and process data chunk by chunk
Direction: Data flows INTO the stream
Use Cases: Writing files, HTTP responses, database writes

Key Methods

write() - Write data to the stream
end() - Signal no more data will be written
destroy() - Forcefully close the stream
